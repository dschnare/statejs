# Overview

Statejs is an event-driven finite state machine implmentation for JavaScript based the article by Eric Dybsand in Best of Game Programming Gems.


# Support

Works in all JavaScript environments as either an AMD, Nodejs or global module.


# Installation

    bower install statejs

Or

    npm install statejs


# API

If not loaded using a module framework then this module exports the following into the global scope. 

**StateMachine()**

	StateMachine()
	StateMachine(name)
	StateMachine({name, [onentry, onexit]})

	name - The name of the initial state (default is "start").
	onentry - The action to be invoke asynchronously when the initial state is entered.
	onexit - The action to be invoke asynchronously when the initial state is exited.

Makes a new state machine with the specified initial state with optional entry and exit actions. 

---

**StateMachine#initialState()**

	initialState()

Retrieves the name of the initial state.

**StateMachine#state()**

	state()
	state(name)

Retrieves the name of the current state. If this method is called with a state name then the state machine will attempt to explicitly transition to the specified state. This is more of a convenience method for changing states manually instead of relying on events to trigger transitions.

**StateMachine.callLater()**

    callLater(fn)

Calls a function at a later time in the future. This can be set to a function that is in sync with your game engine's update loop. By default it's set to `requestAnimationFrame` or `setTimeout`.


**StateMachine#addState()**

	addState(name)
	addState({name, [onentry, onexit]})

	name - Is the state name.
	onentry - The action to be invoke asynchronously when the state is entered.
	onexit - The action to be invoke asynchronously hen the state is exited.
	return - The state object registered.

Adds a state to the state machine.

**StateMachine#addTransition()**

	addTransition({from, to, [guard, [action or actions], [trigger or triggers]]})

	from - The state name the transition will be transitioning from.
	to - The state name the transition will be transitioning to.
	guard - The action to be called to test if the transition should be invoked. If returns false then transition will not take place.
	action - The action to be invoked asynchronousy when the transition is invoked.
	actions - The actions (as an array) to be invoked asynchronously when the transition is invoked.
	trigger - The event name that will trigger this transition.
	triggers - The event names (as an array) that will trigger this transition.

Adds a state transition. The states involved in the transition should be added to the state machine either before or after the transition has been added.

Each transition action is also passed the `event` argument as passed to `trigger()` that caused the transition to be invoked.


**StateMachine#trigger()**

	trigger(eventType)
	trigger(eventObject)

	eventType - An event type as a string.
	eventObject - An object with a "type" property as a string.

Sends an event trigger to the state machine that may or may not trigger a transition. The transition that has a matching trigger will be invoked.
